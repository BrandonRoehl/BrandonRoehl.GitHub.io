At the University of Wisconsin - Eau Claire I had worked in Ruby and developed
Ruby on Rails applications. This had introduced me with the command line for
full fledge development. Prior to this I had only used IDEs.

This is where I had started with bash and eventually move to ZSH but Vim stayed
with me. Now I have always loved IDEs my two favorite being
[Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) and
[InteliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) but Vim was unlike the two of these
right out of the box.

## The Good the Bad and the Ugly

---

### The Good
- Modal Editing
- Command line operation

### The Bad
- No file viewer
- No autocompletion

### The Ugly
- Poor highlighting
- Poor coloring

## Making Vim home

So the thing that made me hate and then love to the point I needed to add the
IntiliJ-Vim plugin was the modal editing. To say that that Vim has a steep
learning curve is an understatement but it is well worth it.
